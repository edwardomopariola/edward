            <h1>My biography</h1>
            <strong><small>My name is Edward Omopariola Jr
            <p>My name is Edward Omopariola Jr, I'm from Africa, Nigeria precisely. I was born in 2002, I relocated to America in 2019 and I'm
            loving it so far. I remember when I initially arrived to America, the first thing I wanted to do was start driving and I never knew everything
            was a process, that started with aquiring learns permit and going to driving school.
            I lived with my dad and my stepmom for almost 2 years. Things were not going well, I would always get blamed for every single mishap, even if 
            even if it had nothing to do with me. Early 2021 I moved in with my aunt and things started turning around for good and better. Few months down the line I started seeing a lot of
            changes, I started playing instruments and began with the saxophone, then eventually learned how to play the keyboard and also Jazz drum. Living with her has been the best birthday present
            ever and I always have an amazing time whenever we are together.</p>

            <h1>Why I wanted to learn coding</h1>
            <strong><small>Learning coding
            <p>In 2022 I started watching action movies that heavily involved the FBI, system hacking and coding. Few months down the line I started developing an interest in coding but never took it as serious
            however, at a point, I began visualizing myself as a coder, building websites and creating apps. Prior to joining coding temple, I was taking a python class with Udemy, but it wasn't really what I want because of a few cons, such as the course being
            self-placed and the lack of active communication, there was simply nobody to reach out to in terms of asking for help. The following week I started exploring and doing research for other coding training programs and courses and came across Coding Temple. Coding Temple has been the best so far; though classes have not officially started
            they do an amazing job of getting me prepared on the subject materials that will be covered in class. By the end of this boothcamp I see myself building apps, creating website, working front-end and back-end and having the ability to write and know different computer languages like
            python, Java, Java Script, using HTML to create websites and CSS for styling websites.</p>
